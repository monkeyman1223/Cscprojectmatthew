In my next part i will show how to get a theme into your newly created hugo website.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"adding-a-theme\"\u003eAdding A Theme\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst you will need to find a theme that is to your liking, you can find some themes from \u003ccode\u003ehttps://themes.gohugo.io/\u003c/code\u003e I chose to go with the theme \u003ccode\u003ehttps://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-zen/\u003c/code\u003e and is what i will be using to show as my example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore we can bring the theme into your website we must navigate our terminal into the \u003ccode\u003ethemes\u003c/code\u003e folder within your websites files.\n\u003cimg src=\"cd_theme.png\" alt=\"a table\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that we have put ourselves into the \u003ccode\u003ethemes\u003c/code\u003e folder we can now begin to bring in the theme you have selected from github. Once you select the theme that you would like to use you need to copy the repository link that is provided. \n\u003cimg src=\"git_theme.png\" alt=\"a table\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the part that can cause issues so be very careful on the next step. we will now clone the theme that you have selected into our website. we are going to be cloning the theme but as a sub-module.\n\u003cimg src=\"git_addsub.png\" alt=\"a table\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow to make sure that we havent messed anything up lets backup to the main folder for your website and make sure everything is still there.\n\u003cimg src=\"cd_back.png\" alt=\"a table\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"ls_project.png\" alt=\"a table\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point you have added a theme to your website. the folder that is now in your \u003ccode\u003ethemes\u003c/code\u003e folder should look something along the lines of this:\n\u003cimg src=\"zen_doc.png\" alt=\"a table\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMost themes come with a example site that you can use to make sure the theme was installed right. in the next part i will show you how to setup the example site.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"example-site\"\u003eExample Site\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt this point we have setup a new hugo website, created a git repoitory, and added a theme to your website. now we will go through the steps of setting up the provided example website provided by the theme.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo start off we need to get our terminal into the example site folder within your theme.\n\u003cimg src=\"cd_themeex.png\" alt=\"a table\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that we are in the example site folder we can now take those files and bring them into your website files by copying them. \n\u003cimg src=\"copy_example.png\" alt=\"a table\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003enow we have copied the files that are within the example site folder and placed them in their coresponding folder within your website. this is done by telling the terminal to place them in the directory that is 3 behind the current one which is represented by \u003ccode\u003e../../..\u003c/code\u003e which just so happens to be your main directory for your website.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ejust to make sure we havent messed anything up and everything is where it should be lets go back to our main website folder and check.\n\u003cimg src=\"ls_main.png\" alt=\"a table\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow all that is left to do is get hugo to serve up the website and see if you did everything correctly. \n\u003cimg src=\"hugo_serve.png\" alt=\"a table\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ethis should produce a website at the following adress \u003ccode\u003ehttp://localhost:1313/\u003c/code\u003e and should look something along the lines of this if you are using the zen theme like me:\n\u003cimg src=\"hugo_servefinal.png\" alt=\"a table\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n"
